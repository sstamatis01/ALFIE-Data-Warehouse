# Dataset Folder Upload - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Complete Implementation

Full support for uploading, downloading, and deleting dataset folders with multiple files!

---

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### 1. Upload Folder with Multiple Files ✅
- **Endpoint**: `POST /datasets/upload/folder/{user_id}`
- Upload ZIP archives containing multiple files
- Auto-versioning (v1, v2, v3)
- Simplified metadata (no column/row analysis for performance)
- File inventory: filenames, sizes, types, hashes

### 2. Download Operations ✅
- **Download entire folder as ZIP**: No filename parameter
- **Download specific file**: Use `?filename=file.csv` parameter
- Works for both latest and version-specific downloads
- Preserves folder structure in ZIP

### 3. Delete Operations ✅
- **Delete single file**: Works as before
- **Delete folder**: Recursively deletes all files
- **Delete all versions**: Handles both single and folder datasets
- **Delete specific version**: Handles both single and folder datasets

### 4. List Files Endpoint ✅
- **Endpoint**: `GET /datasets/{user_id}/{dataset_id}/files`
- Shows all files in folder dataset
- For single files: Returns single-item list
- Includes sizes, types, paths, hashes

## 📊 API Changes

### New Endpoints
```
POST   /datasets/upload/folder/{user_id}    # Upload folder as ZIP
GET    /datasets/{user_id}/{dataset_id}/files  # List files
```

### Modified Endpoints
```
GET    /datasets/{user_id}/{dataset_id}/download
       ?filename={filename}  # NEW: Download specific file from folder

GET    /datasets/{user_id}/{dataset_id}/version/{version}/download
       ?filename={filename}  # NEW: Download specific file from folder

DELETE /datasets/{user_id}/{dataset_id}
       # NOW: Handles folders properly

DELETE /datasets/{user_id}/{dataset_id}/version/{version}
       # NOW: Handles folders properly
```

## 💡 Key Design Decisions (Per Your Requirements)

### ✅ Single File Upload (Unchanged)
- Full metadata extraction
- Columns, rows, data types analyzed
- CSV/Excel parsing
- Best for single tabular files

### ✅ Folder Upload (New)
- **No content analysis** - Much faster!
- Only file inventory: names, sizes, types
- No CSV parsing, no column detection
- Total size calculated
- File types listed

### ✅ Download Flexibility
- Download entire folder as ZIP
- OR download specific file by filename
- Same pattern as AI models API

### ✅ Delete Properly
- Single file: Delete one file
- Folder: Delete all files recursively
- Cascade delete metadata

## 📁 Data Model Updates

### DatasetFile (New)
```python
class DatasetFile(BaseModel):
    filename: str
    file_path: str
    file_size: int
    file_type: str
    file_hash: str
    content_type: Optional[str]
```

### DatasetMetadata (Updated)
```python
class DatasetMetadata(BaseModel):
    # ... existing fields ...
    files: Optional[List[DatasetFile]] = None  # NEW
    is_folder: bool = False                     # NEW
    columns: Optional[List[str]] = None         # Now optional
    row_count: Optional[int] = None             # Now optional
    data_types: Optional[Dict] = None           # Now optional
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Upload Folder
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/datasets/upload/folder/user123" \
  -F "zip_file=@dataset.zip" \
  -F "dataset_id=my-folder" \
  -F "name=My Folder Dataset"
```

### List Files
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/datasets/user123/my-folder/files" | jq

# Output:
# [
#   {"filename": "data1.csv", "file_size": 2048, ...},
#   {"filename": "data2.csv", "file_size": 1024, ...}
# ]
```

### Download Entire Folder
```bash
curl -o folder.zip \
  "http://localhost:8000/datasets/user123/my-folder/download"
```

### Download Specific File
```bash
curl -o data1.csv \
  "http://localhost:8000/datasets/user123/my-folder/download?filename=data1.csv"
```

### Delete Folder
```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8000/datasets/user123/my-folder"

# Response:
# {
#   "message": "All 1 version(s) of dataset deleted successfully",
#   "versions_deleted": 1,
#   "files_deleted": 3,  # All files in folder
#   "files_failed": 0
# }
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run the complete test script:

```bash
python test_dataset_folder_operations.py
```

This script will:
1. ✅ Create test files and ZIP
2. ✅ Upload folder to DW
3. ✅ List files
4. ✅ Download specific file
5. ✅ Download entire folder as ZIP
6. ✅ Delete dataset
7. ✅ Verify deletion
8. ✅ Clean up test files
